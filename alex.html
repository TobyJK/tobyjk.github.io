                    <p>Computer Science has had immense impacts on privacy and data security. One of these impacts is how companies protect their data:</p>
                    <img src="resources/data-breach.jpg" alt="Data breach image">
                    <p>Companies and corporations nowadays often have to take data security into their own hands as governments do not provide any universal data protection
                        Only vague, general guidelines are provided for companies to take into account. These guidelines however are not enough to stop keen criminals from
                        breaching company systems and stealing millions worth of emails and passwords. This is clear from the large amount of data breaches as of late.
                        In 2021 alone(<a href="https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/data-breach-statistics-facts/">Statistics for 2021</a>)
                    </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Criminals are often never found or arrested for commiting cyber-crimes, which means that responsibility for data safety and containment
                        is left solely to the companies that own the data. Which often leads to data being sold on to third parties and millions of customers
                        having their data stolen.

                        Another impact of that computer science has is its impact on copyright:</h5>

                    <p>
                        As the world becomes more interconnected,
                        keeping copyrighted data, such as movies or programs, secure gets harder and harder. Movies and digital media
                        are often pirated and software is often cracked and shared. Companies can often do nothing as the people that crack or pirate
                        are very hard to trace as no real names and information is shared about them. This takes away from profits and negatively affects the economy
